1. What i had to do was create the testdb inside of mysql workbench or you could create it via
   the command line.
2. Also I had to update the application properties to allow for public key retrieval.

3. I also had to add my computers own root username and password.

4. I had to insert the roles because it was complaining about a role that is not found. I had to manually uplaod these
roles to the specified table
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_USER');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_MODERATOR');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');
